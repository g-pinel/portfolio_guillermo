    "text": "Discovery of New Markers for Haemogenic Endothelium and Haematopoietic Progenitors in the Mouse Yolk Sac\nDiez-Pinel, G., Muratore, A., Ruhrberg, C., & Canu, G. (2026). Discovery of New Markers for Haemogenic Endothelium and Haematopoietic Progenitors in the Mouse Yolk Sac. Journal of Developmental Biology, 14(1), 4. https://doi.org/10.3390/jdb14010004\nErythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) originate from the haemogenic endothelium in the yolk sac via an endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) to generate blood and immune cells that support embryo development. Yolk sac-derived EMPs generate blood and immune cells important for embryogenesis and self-renewing tissue-resident macrophages that persist into adulthood.\nI analysed a single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from mouse embryos to identify novel cell surface markers of haemogenic endothelium (Fxyd5 and Scarf1) and EMPs (Fcer1g, Tyrobp, and Mctp1). Further, I identified candidate signalling and metabolic pathways that may regulate yolk sac haematopoietic emergence and differentiation. These insights into the transcriptional dynamics in the yolk sac should support future investigation of EHT and haematopoietic differentiation during early mammalian development.\n\n\n\n\n\nEndothelial transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data challenge the proposed role for TSAd in vascular permeability\nBrash, J.T., Diez-Pinel, G., Rinaldi, L. et al. Endothelial transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data challenge the proposed role for TSAd in vascular permeability. Angiogenesis 28, 21 (2025). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-025-09971-x\nThe vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF drives excessive vascular permeability causing tissue-damaging oedema in neovascular and inflammatory diseases. Several molecular pathways have been implicated in VEGF-induced hyperpermeability, including binding of the receptor VEGFR2 by the T-cell specific adaptor (TSAd) to recruit a SRC family kinase to induce junction opening between vascular endothelial cells (ECs).\nWe have mined publicly available omics data (bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, proteomics, epigenomics) for expression of TSAd and other permeability-relevant signal transducers in multiple organs affected by VEGF-induced vascular permeability. TSAd protein and transcripts were largely undetected or expressed at extremely low levels in all datasets analysed, inconsistent with a universal role for TSAd in permeability signalling."

In this type of analysis, all genes expressed by the input samples are sorted from those most enriched in one condition to those most enriched in the other, generating a ranked list. Then specific groups of genes are tested against this ranked list to identify those gene sets that are enriched in one of the biological states.\nHowever, standard GSEA analyses do not support controlling for covariates like sex and age. To overcome this, you can supply GSEA with your own ranked list of genes (GSEA Preranked). Differential expression analysis packages like R’s DESeq2, allow to control for covariates, and the test statistic that they output can be used as the ranking metric for the resulting genes.\nThe scripts in this repository allows you to easily generate the RNK files needed to run GSEA preranked by supplying DESeq2 objects (as RDS files) or results tables (as CSV files). You can do this in batch for multiple input files. In addition, scripts for running one or multiple GSEA preranked analyses with a single command is also provided. You can use the RNK files obtained with the code in this repository, or provide your own.\nYou can find more information about GSEA here.\n\n\nqPCR analyzer\nhttps://github.com/g-pinel/qPCR-analyzer\n\nProcess your qRT-PCR data generated using the QuantStudio software with a single command. Simply provide your QuantStudio output excel files to obtain CTs, delta CTs, and levels (2-ΔCt).  Both XLS and XLSX supported, as well as combining multiple files from the same project."
