In this type of analysis, all genes expressed by the input samples are sorted from those most enriched in one condition to those most enriched in the other, generating a ranked list. Then specific groups of genes are tested against this ranked list to identify those gene sets that are enriched in one of the biological states.\nHowever, standard GSEA analyses do not support controlling for covariates like sex and age. To overcome this, you can supply GSEA with your own ranked list of genes (GSEA Preranked). Differential expression analysis packages like R’s DESeq2, allow to control for covariates, and the test statistic that they output can be used as the ranking metric for the resulting genes.\nThe scripts in this repository allows you to easily generate the RNK files needed to run GSEA preranked by supplying DESeq2 objects (as RDS files) or results tables (as CSV files). You can do this in batch for multiple input files. In addition, scripts for running one or multiple GSEA preranked analyses with a single command is also provided. You can use the RNK files obtained with the code in this repository, or provide your own.\nYou can find more information about GSEA here."
