### Discovery of New Markers for Haemogenic Endothelium and Haematopoietic Progenitors in the Mouse Yolk Sac

Diez-Pinel, G., Muratore, A., Ruhrberg, C., & Canu, G. (2026). Discovery of New Markers for Haemogenic Endothelium and Haematopoietic Progenitors in the Mouse Yolk Sac. *Journal of Developmental Biology*, 14(1), 4. <https://doi.org/10.3390/jdb14010004> 

Erythro-myeloid progenitors (EMPs) originate from the haemogenic endothelium in the yolk sac via an endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition (EHT) to generate blood and immune cells that support embryo development. They are also give rise to self-renewing tissue-resident macrophages that persist into adulthood.

I analysed a single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from mouse embryos to identify novel cell surface markers of haemogenic endothelium (*Fxyd5* and *Scarf1*) and EMPs (*Fcer1g*, *Tyrobp*, and *Mctp1*). Further, I identified candidate signalling and metabolic pathways that may regulate yolk sac haematopoietic emergence and differentiation. These insights into the transcriptional dynamics in the yolk sac should support future investigation of EHT and haematopoietic differentiation during early mammalian development.

### Endothelial transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data challenge the proposed role for TSAd in vascular permeability

Brash, J.T., Diez-Pinel, G., Rinaldi, L. et al. Endothelial transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data challenge the proposed role for TSAd in vascular permeability. *Angiogenesis* 28, 21 (2025). <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-025-09971-x>

The vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF drives excessive vascular permeability causing tissue-damaging oedema in neovascular and inflammatory diseases. Several molecular pathways have been implicated in VEGF-induced hyperpermeability, including binding of the receptor VEGFR2 by the T-cell specific adaptor (TSAd) to recruit a SRC family kinase to induce junction opening between vascular endothelial cells (ECs).

We have mined publicly available omics data (bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, proteomics, epigenomics) for expression of TSAd and other permeability-relevant signal transducers in multiple organs affected by VEGF-induced vascular permeability. TSAd protein and transcripts were largely undetected or expressed at extremely low levels in all datasets analysed, inconsistent with a universal role for TSAd in permeability signalling.

### The BulkECexplorer compiles endothelial bulk transcriptomes to predict functional versus leaky transcription

Brash, J.T., Diez-Pinel, G., Colletto, C. et al. The BulkECexplorer compiles endothelial bulk transcriptomes to predict functional versus leaky transcription. *Nat Cardiovasc Res* 3, 460–473 (2024). <https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-024-00436-w>

RNA-seq experiments may detect lowly expressed mRNAs thought to be biologically irrelevant products of leaky transcription. To represent the functional transcriptome of endothelial cells (ECs) more accurately, we propose compiling many EC bulk RNA-seq datasets into a compendium and applying established classification models to predict whether detected transcripts are likely products of active or leaky transcription.

The [BulkECexplorer web application](https://ruhrberglab.shinyapps.io/BulkECexplorer/) can be used to query any protein-coding gene and generate informative dashboards combining transcriptomic data from 240 mouse and human EC samples in seconds. These samples include 5 EC subtypes commonly used in vascular biology research: HUVECs and HDMECs (human); lung, brain and retina ECs (mouse).

### Endothelial Cell RNA-Seq Data: Differential Expression and Functional Enrichment Analyses to Study Phenotypic Switching

Diez-Pinel, G. Horder J. L. et al. (2022). Endothelial Cell RNA-Seq Data: Differential Expression and Functional Enrichment Analyses to Study Phenotypic Switching. In: Benest, A.V. (eds) *Angiogenesis. Methods in Molecular Biology*, vol 2441. Humana, New York, NY. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-2059-5_29

RNA-seq is a common approach used to explore gene expression data between experimental conditions or cell types and ultimately leads to information that can shed light on the biological processes involved and inform further hypotheses.

We wrote a user-friendly bioinformatics workflow which describes the methods required to take raw data produced by RNA sequencing to interpretable results.

### A Pax3 lineage gives rise to transient haematopoietic progenitors

Giovanni Canu, Rosamaria Correra, Guillermo Diez-Pinel, Raphaël F. P. Castellan, Laura Denti, Alessandro Fantin, Christiana Ruhrberg; A Pax3 lineage gives rise to transient haematopoietic progenitors. *Development* 1 December 2024; 151 (23): dev202924. doi: <https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.202924>

During embryonic development, muscle tissues, skin, and a subset of vascular endothelial cells arise from Pax3-expressing embryonic progenitors defined as paraxial mesoderm.

To determine whether the haematopoietic system also contains *Pax3* lineage cells (cells that express *Pax3*, or whose progenitors expressed *Pax3* at any point in the past), I analysed a bulk RNA-seq dataset of Pax3-derived cells from embryonic day 12.5 mouse limbs. I found that, apart from expression of expected musculoskeletal and endothelial markers, transcripts typical of haematopoietic progenitors (e.g. *Kit*, *Vav1*, *Runx1*) were also present.

The finding suggests that a *Pax3* lineage may give rise to a subset of haematopoietic cells. *Pax3* lineage haematopoietic cells should be investigated to better understand normal haematopoietic development from different mesodermal derivatives. Further, genetic alterations of *Pax3* lineage haematopoietic cells should be investigated for their potential to cause haematopoietic malignancies.
